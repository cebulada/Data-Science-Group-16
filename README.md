## Type of Analysis

- Our group would like to do several types of analysis with the dataset

- 1. Time Series Analysis of all Bicycle Trips summarized by hour / day / week / month aggregation with the following dependant attributes:
    - trip duration
    - trip distance (calculated by Haversine formula using Latitude and Longitude values)
    - count of each user types (pivot column)
    - count of each start station (pivot column)
    - count of each end station (pivot column)
    - count of each gender (pivot column)
    - count of each birth year (pivot column)

- 2. Perform Bayesian Analysis of Bike Trip Data (Naive Bayes)
    - modify several parameters and observe the changes in simulated Bike Trip data

## Project Requirements

- 1. Make a hypothesis about a correlation in a dataset and test the hypothesis using a statistical inference technique (such as the t-test).
- 2. Build a predictive model using one of the techniques covered in the course, i.e., ordinary least squares regression or Na√Øve Bayes.

## Group Project Requirements

- 1. Collaborate with peers to solve a Data Science Problem
- 2. Work in a group setting to complete a challenge within an agreed-upon time frame
- 3. Engage with peers to discover their problem-solving process and lessons learned
- 4. Carry out a statistical analysis using real data
- 5. Hone Skills in explaining technical details to a non-technical audience
